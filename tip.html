        <h2><q>Fully vaccinated</q> doesn’t mean <q>immune to COVID-19</q></h2> <br>
        <p> 
            As restrictions and mask mandates are dropped around the county, people who are fully vaccinated might be
            feeling the return-to-normal fantasy. But Dr. Cardona warns that now still isn’t the time to let your guard
            down. While the vaccines are potent, there’s still a chance that you could become infected. <br><br>
            Dr. Cardona explains. <br><br>
           <q>‘Fully vaccinated’ means that you completed a COVID-19 vaccine series as recommended for the best
            protection against severe complications such as hospitalizations and/or death. No vaccine offers 100%
            protection against illness, yet it does give you a better chance to fight off the infectious consequences of being
            exposed to the SARS-CoV2 virus.</q> <br><br>
            <h2>Can fully vaccinated people still transmit the virus to others,
            including other vaccinated people?</h2><br><br>
            While it is possible, Dr. Cardona says that the ability to transmit COVID-19 may occur at a lower rate. She adds
            that this could also be a reality for people who don’t have a good immune response to vaccines. <br><br>
           <q>The elderly, those with immune or chronic health conditions or those with underlying health disorders may
            not have the best protective response to vaccines, such as the COVID-19 vaccines. We are still collecting data
            and doing ongoing research about the vaccine responses in these vulnerable populations.</q>
